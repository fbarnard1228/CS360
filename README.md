Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app I deveopled was a weight tracking app that requires a database with three tables to store daily weight records, user logins and passwords, and a constant goal weight. A login screen doubles as a sign-up portal for new users, ensuring ease of access. Users can view all their daily weights displayed in a grid format alongside their entry dates. The app includes features allowing users to add their daily weight and set a goal weight. Additionally, it has a notification mechanism to alert users when they reach their goal weight, ensuring they stay motivated and on track. These requirements collectively ensure comprehensive functionality for users to track and achieve their weight goals efficiently.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The application had necessary screens, such as a login/registration screen and a primary dashboard showing daily weights, in order to establish a user-centered user interface. Along with a notification system for when goals were reached, features for adding daily weights and setting goal weights were included. With its user-friendly navigation, clear labels, and visual cues, the user interface (UI) was created with simplicity of use in mind. These design decisions made sure the application successfully met user needs, improving the user experience as a whole. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I was not very good at the coding in this assignment, I did not have enough time to get what I wanted done. If I had the time I would have approached coding my app by breaking it into manageable sections, performing unit tests on each part. Techniques like modular coding and reusable components streamline the process. These strategies enhance efficiency and can be applied to future projects for better organization and quality.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

In order to identify problems early and make sure every component worked as intended, I tested my code using unit tests on individual components. End-to-end testing replicated actual user situations, whereas integration tests verified how various modules interacted with one another. This procedure is essential because it guarantees that the code functions as intended, identifies errors early, and verifies that every component of the application functions as a whole. It identified areas that required development and guaranteed the app's general robustness and dependability. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Even without finishing the app, the journey itself often brings innovative solutions. One challenge would have been managing user authentication. To overcome it, I might have integrated a third-party authentication service like Firebase or Auth0, streamlining secure user login without building it from scratch.


In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I particularly showcased my skills in the UI component of the mobile app. By designing an intuitive and engaging interface, I ensured users could easily navigate and use the app. The use of clear labels, visual cues, and a consistent layout made the app visually appealing and user-friendly. This focus on a seamless user experience demonstrated my understanding of user-centered design principles and my ability to implement them effectively.
